# Overview of the Frontend Structure:
The frontend was developed by Jo√£o Silva (up202107600). I use "Android Studio" in order to build the graphical part of the application. The designs are build on .xml files. To make the logical part (make the necessary connections between the frontend and the backend via endpoints), I used java.

## Android Studio Activities
### Login Activity
The user logins (with username and password) here. There's a button to register, that leads us to the next activity.

### Registration Activity
A user makes his registration here, using username, email, password, country and phone number.

### Main Activity
Where the movies are listed

### Account Settings

When a movie is selected, we can see further info about it on a new screen. There, we can choose between 2 different qualities: "1080p" and "360p".

We also have an admin login, where he can add and remove movies and delete accounts as well.
